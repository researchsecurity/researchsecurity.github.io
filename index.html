In a world where accountability is key, there are two things we cannot allow bottlenecks or take strategic thinking for granted.  That's why, with Emergency Response Security Group, we offer strategic solutions and expert insights essential for any business, at a reasonable rate. We don't sell bloatware, we don't attend meetings about meetings and we definately do not compromise your values for our convenience.  We are real people, domestic to the United States, who respond to emails and answer the phones.  We've seen the industry explode overnight and understand anger at forced automation loops in automated phone systems, broken checkout lines and repetitive chat bots that redirect you to documentation.  That isn't working or helpful.  Collectively, we are automation weary.  We have seen enough of passing the buck of accountability, which can only remain sustainable for so long.  That's why, with Emergency Response Security Group we endeavor to offer something different:  We will never route you to a call center, and we will never use an automated platforms to respond.  We will never sell you an expensive snake oil solution that promises to fix everything when that outcome is not guaranteed.  We are offering contracts, on an age-tested truth, a relationship between business and client.  Let us be the people you can trust.

The SOC model has been played out, and we find it is not only inefficient but ineffective. With 26 years of experience I know I can solve that problem for you.
If you base your response on ticket stacks, and meetings about meetings that revolve around the sun that is MTTR, perhaps a better plan should be in the works.  Many businesses typically invest over $40,000 for basic services, but we offer more, for less.  It's true that we have developed a cost-effective monthly pricing structure that ensures you receive top-tier consulting without the hefty price tag. This approach not only allows us to earn your trust as high-quality consultants but also fuels the growth of our boutique Cyber Security Firm. Whether you require expert consultation, detailed explanations, validation of  security concerns, comprehensive audits, or innovative guidance that blends critical and  creative thinking, we are here to assist. Our services are priced to be accessible for the level of value, ensuring that superior cybersecurity support is within your reach.
