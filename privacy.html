<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Emergency Response Security Group</strong> ("ERSG," "we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have concerning your information. We value your trust and are transparent about our practices—most importantly, <strong>we do <u>not</u> and will <u>never</u> sell your personal data to anyone, under any circumstances.</strong></p>

<hr>

    <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> that are strictly necessary for site functionality and security.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not collect sensitive personal data</strong> unless you voluntarily provide it and it is necessary for a specific feature you request.</p>

</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> share data for cross‑context behavioral advertising or with data brokers.</p>
